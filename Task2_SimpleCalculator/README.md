#  Task 2 – Simple Calculator

This is my second project for the **CodSoft C++ Internship**.  
In this task, I made a small **calculator program** using basic arithmetic operations in C++.

---

##  About the Project
The calculator takes two numbers as input and allows the user to choose an operation —  
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, or Division.  
It then displays the result instantly in a simple console format.

I also added a check so that if the user tries to divide by zero,  
the program will show an error message instead of crashing.

##  What I Used
I have used the following C++ concepts:
- Input/Output (`cin`, `cout`)
- Switch statement for operation selection
- Basic arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Conditional check for division by zero

##  Sample Output
==============================
       SIMPLE CALCULATOR
==============================
Enter first number: 30
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): + 
Enter second number: 40
Result: 70.00

##  How to Run
You can compile and run it using any C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o main
main
