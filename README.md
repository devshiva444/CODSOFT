# CodSoft C++ Internship Projects (Batch B59 - October 2025)

Hello everyone! 👋  
This repository contains my work for the **CodSoft C++ Internship** (Batch B59).  
During this internship, I learned and practiced core C++ programming concepts by completing multiple small projects.

Each project helped me improve my problem-solving, logic building, and hands-on coding skills in C++.
